# RedFract-ol

## Overview

This project is a fractal generator implemented in C, created for the 42's school. The program is capable of rendering various types of fractals, providing a visually appealing exploration of mathematical patterns. The supported fractals include:

- **Mandelbrot**
- **All Julia Sets**
- **Burningship**
- **Newton**

## Features

- **Zoom Functionality:** Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
- **Pan Control:** Navigate through the fractal space using the arrow keys or using right click.
- **Color Themes:** Switch between different color themes by pressing the '1' numpad key.
- **Smooth Rendering:** Toggle smooth rendering on and off by pressing '2'.
- **Interactive Julia Set:** In Julia sets, press the space bar to dynamically change the Julia parameters using the mouse.
